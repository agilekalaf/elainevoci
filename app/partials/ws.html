<p>Each quarter, I facilitate life skills workshops designed to help clients develop the emotional and psychological
    resources and strengths to meet life’s challenges; enable them to make better choices that result in success and
    happiness; and to provide greater self-awareness, understanding and knowledge of the unique gifts each brought into
    this life. These workshops have helped people discover and use their personal power to free themselves from the past
    in order to reinvent themselves and build a self-image that more closely aligns with the self they experience. </p>
<p><strong>Ideal Participant:</strong></p>
<p>If you seek to know yourself better, to heal painful life experiences, and/or to reinvent yourself in order to find a
    new career, begin a new relationship, or create a new outlook on life, then these workshops can be a great source of
    inspiration, new energy and enjoyment. </p>
