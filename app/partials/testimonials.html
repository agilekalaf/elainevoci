<p><strong>Comments about Elaine's life coaching:</strong></p>

<p><em>&quot;As a career changer who has had her own business for 25 years, I was at a loss as to how to proceed with an employment search. Elaine has steered me in many directions I would not have thought of on my own and helped me in developing a resume and cover letter. She is a very creative, sincere, positive, and caring individual. Her enthusiasm is contagious.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;As a speaker, or group facilitator, Elaine has a special gift that allows her to connect with every individual making them feel like they have been heard. Her welcoming and safe presence encourages people to open up and share. I've witnessed it from entry level to C-Level. For authenticity, for honesty, for results, I highly recommend Elaine to any group.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;Elaine has a gift...to see through and identify her clients' personal walls and roadblocks to success. She then guides them along a path that enables them to move toward becoming the productive, effective business professionals they envision! Expect to look at life differently!&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;Elaine has the amazing ability that few do, of having an immediate calming influence over anyone she's with. She is also incredibly wise, able to easily discern what areas should be focal points to concentrate on and is very good at connecting like-minded individuals. She is a cheerleader, therapist, editor, writer and many other things all in one.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;Elaine is one of those amazing individuals who come into our lives for once but then, during each subsequent encounter, are able to teach us to grow and excel in all aspects of our lives. She is a spiritual individual who imparts wisdom and light in a most endearing way. She is also an author who has documented examples of women who have 'eliminated barriers' to attain amazing results. Working with Elaine has helped me achieve many of my goals. Her approach is highly individualized. This and many other attributes clearly differentiate Elaine from others in her field. Thank you Elaine! These are simple words but they are from my heartâ€¦you're a prism that takes in light and reflects back many untapped facets of that same light. Consult with Elaine and watch your universe improve!&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I can't thank Elaine enough. I had a hard time finding what I wanted to do next in life and felt I was starting to waste my time. She helped me to get clear on what I didn't want - no more cubicles for me! and gave me permission to have a blended lifestyle. That means I don't have to give something up in order to try new things. With my new food business about to launch I have never felt happier. Food is such a great connector of people across cultures and I love making it and sharing it with others. I feel SO alive. Thank you Elaine for all your support, connections and direction. I only wish we had met 3 years ago. If you're not completely happy with your work/life balance, go see Elaine, the possibilities are endless - and you'll be very glad that you did!&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;After working with Elaine for the past several months, I would highly recommend her as a career coach. She helped me through a challenging work experience, offering wise counsel and assisting me in making a decision that was best for me and my family. Tapping in to a variety of credible resources and the latest information on the job market, she helped me define a new career path, as well as develop a new resume and cover letters. Elaine is incredibly supportive and has a gift for telling you what you need to hear just when you need it the most. She is a highly skilled and compassionate professional. I appreciate her empathy, responsiveness and most of all, the amount of dedicated time and energy she devotes to her clients. &quot;</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;Elaine has the unique ability to help you see your own potential. She can be honest and direct when providing feedback in a way that helps you see where you need to grow. She is also a great &quot;connector&quot; -- connecting people to resources or other people. I would highly recommend Elaine as coach, counselor or mentor!&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;In life, we may be lucky to come in contact with a few people who really impact the way we see things. Elaine is one of those rare individuals who, through listening and guidance, can do just that. I had never used the services of a life skills coach before meeting Elaine, but in the course of a career transition she became instrumental in helping me see the landscape of my situation in new and exciting ways.&quot;</em></p>
