				<p><strong>Comments about Elaine's life coaching:</strong></p><p>
					Thank you for helping me give my sadness a name.  You truly are a 'prism' of light because you are always able to help me find such clarity.  </p>
<p>
Thank you; you are a wonderful heart- centered teacher and I have a renewed sense of understanding and determination that anything is possible with perseverance.</p>
<p>
I thank you for your gentleness, generosity of spirit, and wonderful insights.  I just feel so supported and so "okay". I now can move forward with more confidence.</p>
<p>
We both really felt that we gained so much from your time with us.  You have a great gift and I feel you are using it to maximum advantage to help the people with whom you relate.  Thank you.</p>
<p>
Thank you for all you do to bring healing into the world.  Your loving caring heart has helped me open mine to the world.</p>
<p>
<strong>Here are client testimonials for the Creating the Work You Love workshop:</strong></p><p>
This workshop had a lot of variety which I loved; I found it helpful when we did our team break out sessions which inspired building some new relationships, and I loved your stories, humor and the vocal variety in the tone you used to tell us such great true stories.  I look forward to taking more classes.</p>
<p>
I learned a great deal and became excited about the job search process, instead of dreading it. I love the energy you bring and the way you touch everyone's experience to give us all wonderful feedback.  Your Nine legacies of Love and the advice to first find a life and then find a job is perfect!</p>
<p>
I feel better prepared to make a job search by knowing that we hunt for jobs the same way we live our lives and now that I know my own style, I am ready to go out there!  Thank you very much for this class - it had a lot of good information and it was inspiring.</p>
<p>
An excellent class!  It helped bring hope back into my career change - thank you!</p>
<p>
This class helped me realize that I need to figure out my passion first and then go for it.  The Legacy of Love exercise is a smart way to live, too.  It made me answer the key question of what do I want to be remembered for; thank you, Elaine.</p>
