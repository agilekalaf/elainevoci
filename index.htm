<p><strong>My Career Path</strong><br>
I have enjoyed happy, successful careers in:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Teaching </li>
  <li>Counseling (including alcohol and drug abuse counseling)</li>
  <li>Cross Cultural Communication training in Japan</li>
  <li>Corporate Training and Development in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia</li>
  <li>Life coaching and Mentoring</li>
  <li>Public Speaking to audiences as small as 4 and as large as 2,000</li>
</ul>
<p>I am the granddaughter of Italian immigrants who came to America in search of a better life for their children.  From the time I was a small child, the values of education and philanthropy were emphasized as the basis of a successful life and for leaving the world a better place.  As a result of this family influence, I earned advanced degrees in psychology, rehabilitation science and human resource management and have regularly supported local charities.  While my studies were diverse and unique, each program strengthened my understanding of human personality, motivation, and the desire to strive toward goals, and to work at something that matters.  These were bound by the common fabrics of communication and an instinct to help others.  </p>
<p><br>
  I love teaching and my personal mission has revolved around the roles of teacher, writer and coach. I first worked as a therapist in alcohol/drug abuse counseling where I learned the meaning of holistic health –  we cannot separate the physical, emotional and spiritual dimensions of an illness if we are to help create the conditions for getting well and recovering.  </p>
<p><br>
  I gradually moved into corporate training where I spent more than 20 years creating training programs, managing training departments, and mentoring training staff and trainees.  I have written about the human elements in business in many publications, including the <em>Indianapolis Business Journal, Indianapolis Woman magazine</em> and <em>CEO magazine.  </em></p>
<p><em> </em><br>
  Being a life coach is a natural extension of my first work and training as a Gestalt therapist and a perfect complement to my background in teaching, training and communication.   The &ldquo;tool kit&rdquo; that I have assembled over the years is full, rich in diverse experience and enables me to connect sincerely with clients with compassion and caring.  I define my work as my calling, My passion is to serve others  as they set goals and strive to reach them successfully.</p>
<p><br>
  The career coaching I provide reflects the wide range of work experiences I have enjoyed in the U.S. and overseas.  When I navigated my first career change, it was a career coach who taught me about the hidden job market and how to use networking to open up the field of possibilities.  I teach my clients that same process now, drawing heavily from Richard Bolles&rsquo; classic book, <em>What Color&rsquo;s Your Parachute? </em> </p>
<p><br>
  What I love most about life coaching is the opportunity to help others see their own beauty and to assist in their personal healing and transformation – whether that means finding a job that makes their heart sing,  exploring an encore career after retirement, or integrating a personal life transition.  It is a privilege to assist others in a journey of the spirit that they intentionally choose to travel, one that will move them toward more joy, living an authentic life with a clear sense of purpose.  </p>
<p><br>
  <strong>My Clients</strong><br>
  I love working with men and women from different walks of life who want to grow personally and professionally.  Some of the characteristics they share in common are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>being open to learning</li>
  <li>having a desire to want more from life</li>
  <li>a passion to live the authentic life that is uniquely theirs   </li>
</ul>
<p>(Please read more about my approach to coaching on the FAQs found on the sidebar of this home page. )</p>
<p><strong> What is Coaching?</strong><br/>
</p>
<p> I believe that coaching is a mutually responsible relationship between coaches and clients designed to help clients determine their own destiny. Just as Olympic athletes don’t rely solely on physical training without the support, objective feedback and experience of an athletic coach, many of today’s most successful leaders, entrepreneurs and individuals utilize the perspective and experience of a coach to help lift their personal lives and careers to the next level.</p>
<p><strong>Why Does Coaching Work?</strong><br/>
</p>
<p><strong>Accountability</strong> is built in.  In addition to monthly face to face coaching sessions, I provide 1-2 calls and unlimited e-mail exchanges each month with clients; this encourages them to work harder at their goals than if they were working alone. You can relate to this if you work out with a personal trainer at the gym – you work harder at those times than when you work out by yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Expertise</strong> counts.   As a trained life coach and a former therapist, I know how to listen to both feelings and words.  This helps you think with more clarity, and structure your personal and professional life around the right goals to improve productivity and life satisfaction. You'll achieve more in less time with input that is supportive, motivating, compassionate and real world-based.</p>
<p><strong>Delivery</strong> makes a difference. An objective, positive coach knows how to motivate without arm-twisting or nagging.  My combined approach of monthly face to face sessions, 1-2 calls a month, and unlimited emails gives you time to integrate new ways of thinking and acting.  Being coached is energizing and uplifting and, even when it’s challenging, there is a sense of growing self-confidence that helps make it fun.</p>
<p><strong>Fast results</strong> are motivating. Most people find that things start to happen quickly after hiring a coach.  Events seem to gain momentum, and each day brings renewed enthusiasm for success in reaching goals that naturally motivate you. If there’s a gap between where you are today and where you want to be, you are a good candidate for coaching.  I will help you close the gap, and help you break through limited beliefs.  I will challenge you to think on a bigger scale about what is possible.  As one client put it, “…you helped me see the landscape of my situation in new and exciting ways.”</p>
<p><strong>What Are the Benefits of Hiring a Coach?</strong></p>
<ul class="faq">
  <li>You start making more focused and effective choices that are congruent with your values</li>
  <li>You stop tolerating what is no longer acceptable to you from others and from yourself</li>
  <li>You see more clearly the options you have to support you in changing your life</li>
  <li>You set and achieve goals that are based on what you really want in life</li>
  <li>You set clear boundaries in your life that bring a sense of empowerment and joy</li>
  <li>You have more energy and enthusiasm for life</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Are You a Good Candidate for Coaching?</strong><br />
</p>
<p>If there’s a gap between where you are today in your personal and professional life and where you want to be, you are a good candidate for coaching.  Clients seek coaching for many different reasons, but they share some common characteristics listed below.  See how many of them apply to you:</p>
<ol>
  <li>They are ready for a change – they want life to be different in some significant area.</li>
  <li>They feel unsure of where to start but they are motivated to make a change happen.</li>
  <li>They have tried some things in the past, on their own or with the help of a loved one, that haven’t produced the results they wanted or illuminated the right answers.</li>
  <li>They are prepared to look deeply into what they are most passionate about and the kind of legacy they want to leave.</li>
  <li>They sense that they are ready to make a major decision but they lack the confidence to step out and do it.</li>
</ol>
