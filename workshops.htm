		<p>Each quarter, I facilitate life skills workshops designed to help clients develop the emotional and psychological resources and strengths to meet life’s challenges; enable them to make better choices that result in success and happiness; and to provide greater self-awareness, understanding and knowledge of the unique gifts each brought into this life.  These workshops have helped people discover and use their personal power to free themselves from the past in order to reinvent themselves and build a self-image that more closely aligns with the self they experience.</p>
		<p>Each workshop registration is prepaid because only ten seats are available at a time.  A waiting list is created when that number is exceeded.  The costs are kept low intentionally in order to make them available to as many people as possible.</p> 

		<p><strong>Ideal Participant:</strong></p>
		 <p>If you seek to know yourself better, to heal painful life experiences, and/or to reinvent yourself in order to find a new career, begin a new relationship, or create a new outlook on life, then these workshops can be a great source of inspiration, new energy and enjoyment.</p>

		<p><strong>Life Skills Coaching Workshops</strong>– each of these classes meets once a week for four weeks and each meeting is two hours long.  The fee is $40.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Managing Transitions</strong> – learn how transitions begin with endings, contain a neutral zone and then move to new beginnings; understand what each stage requires of you; put your transitions into a new perspective and learn the difference between change and transition.</li>
				<li><strong>What Happy People Know</strong> – what makes you unique; what you notice and the meanings you assign; how self knowledge is the basis for all other growth; and what brings happiness (surprise, it’s not how much money you have)</li>

				<li><strong>Signature Workshops</strong> –  each of these classes stands alone and is offered regularly; check the website for dates and times.  The fees are listed below.</li>
				<li><strong><a href="Creating_work_you_love.htm">Creating the Work You Love</a></strong> – a three hour workshop that provides clarity, vision, facts, inspiration and – most importantly – an opportunity for you to explore your heart’s true desires regarding your career in a small group experience. Fee is $40.</li>
				<li><strong><a href="IHworkshops1.htm">Intent Heals&trade;</a></strong> – a two-hour, life-changing healing workshop designed to facilitate a deeper awareness and appreciation of the people who have touched and shaped your life and to awaken to the power of intention.  A personal journal, handmade in Nepal, is included for the workshop process and for continued journaling after the workshop.  The fee is $30.</li>
