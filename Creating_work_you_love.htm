		<h2>Career Workshop: 
		Creating the Work You Love</h2>
		<hr/>
		<p>Unhappy in your current career?  Not certain what the current trends are in emerging careers and which jobs are most in demand today?  Do you lack clarity, vision, or courage when you try to imagine yourself doing work that’s soul satisfying?  Are you reluctant to learn new things in order to reinvent yourself?  This workshop is designed to help you find your right path.</p>
		<p>In today’s marketplace, we all need to adopt a mindset of the self-employed individual and accept responsibility for being our own boss, even when we work for someone else.  The old “social contract” has been broken and replaced with one that holds independence (making individual contributions) and interdependence (collaboration with others) as its core elements.</p>
<p>This three hour workshop will provide answers, facts, inspiration, and – most importantly – an opportunity for you to explore your heart’s true desires.   Elaine Voci, Ph.D. brings superb facilitation skills, and a fascinating work history of 30 years in which she changed careers – not just jobs- more than six times, including one that meant moving to Japan.  Elaine has successfully practiced in her own career what she is going to teach you- and nine other attendees- about reinventing yourself.</p>  

		<p>In this small group process in a relaxed setting, you and fellow attendees will explore:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>How to use your talents, interests and values to mobilize your career</li>
			<li>Emerging trends in careers and which jobs are most in demand right now</li>
			<li>The decision to go back to school, or not – and the value and need for ongoing learning</li>
			<li>The power of networking and the hidden job market</li>
			<li>How to express your authentic self on your resume</li>
			<li>Preparing for successful interviews - ten key actions you need to know and master</li>
		</ul><p>The workshop is open to only ten participants; the fee of $40 includes light snacks and beverages.  Each person is asked to bring 12 copies of their current resume, a notebook and pen, and curiosity, which is a gift of learning.</p>
        <p><strong>Here's what people are saying about the workshop:</strong></p>
        <p><em>&quot;This workshop had a lot of variety which I loved; I found it helpful when we did our team break out sessions which inspired building some new relationships, and I loved your stories, humor and the vocal variety in the tone you used to tell us such great true stories. I look forward to taking more classes.&quot;</em></p>
<p>
  <em>&quot;I learned a great deal and became excited about the job search process, instead of dreading it. I love the energy you bring and the way you touch everyone's experience to give us all wonderful feedback. Your Nine legacies of Love and the advice to first find a life and then find a job is perfect!&quot;</em></p>
<p>
  <em>&quot;I feel better prepared to make a job search by knowing that we hunt for jobs the same way we live our lives and now that I know my own style, I am ready to go out there! Thank you very much for this class - it had a lot of good information and it was inspiring.&quot;</em></p>
<p>
  <em>&quot;An excellent class! It helped bring hope back into my career change - thank you!&quot;</em></p>
<p>
  <em>&quot;This class helped me realize that I need to figure out my passion first and then go for it. The Legacy of Love exercise is a smart way to live, too. It made me answer the key question of what do I want to be remembered for; thank you, Elaine.&quot;</em></p>
