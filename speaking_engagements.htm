                <p><strong>An evening with Andy Murphy: Author, literary agent, founder and Executive Director of WriteStuff Writer's Conferences & Events. No Excuses: Don't Rob Yourself of a Life-Changing Adventure.</strong>Andy will discuss how life allows us many chances to succeed or to fail. Too often, as women, we make excuses about why we can’t do something when, instead, we should ask ourselves, “What’s stopping me?”</p>

                <p><strong>An evening with the Jo Zickmund: Large Crane Operator, licensed journeyman, animal advocate. Bury Me In My Carhartts! </strong>Crane operators are among the highest paid equipment operators in the heavy construction professions. They are also in high demand. But few operators are female. While some men welcome female coworkers, others think they are a joke or a novelty and try to make life miserable enough to chase them away. Overall, women operators have to work harder to gain respect. Not to mention that it takes years of seat time and learning the ropes before fellow workers develop confidence in a co-worker’s ability to operate the crane safely. Most of us have never met a female crane operator. Meet Jo Zickmund, a successful large crane operator who works in Indiana and surrounding states.</p>

                <p><strong>An evening with the Women Build Project of the Johnson County Habitat for Humanity: Home is where the Heart Is! 
                </strong>There have been 1,500 Habitat for Humanity homes built by women-only work crews in the US and around the world. One of them was built in nearby Johnson County last fall when 240 female volunteers raised a record $85,000 for their Habitat&rsquo;s first-ever Women Build project, more than any other Johnson County Habitat project. They approached the build with a uniquely feminine touch of class and wore matching pink shirts and hard hats and used shovels artfully decorated with paint, flower patterns, zebra stripes and ribbon to break ground. The end result was a safe and comfortable 1,200 square-foot ranch home in Franklin for new home owner, Brandy Shockley and her two daughters. Four members of this unique construction team will share the inspiring story of their empowerment and teamwork that received national recognition, and they will describe the life lessons they learned from engaging in this positive project. </p>
